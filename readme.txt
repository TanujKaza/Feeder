Reflection Essay:
	This project was the first major project for most of us and certainly on which taught us a lot. Having built websites only in plain-old PHP prior to this, a web framework like Django was a lot easier once we understood how it worked and we got the hang of it. Django has a lot of functionality and very little code is required for it, and this id just what we need in this day and age.

	We learnt how to develop user friendly portals, interactive UI and many mnay other features that Django provides.

	Regarding Social Login, we hit a brick wall when we tried to do login for Gmail using their API. We spent a lot of time on this before we eventually gave up on Gmail Login and attempted to do facebook login at which we succeeded. In hindsight, this time could have been used more wisely.

	Coming to Android, even here we spent almost a whole week trying to do the authentication using oauth and not just plain java. Oauth being more secure was the preferred choice, and although we tried and tried, we finally had to resort to Java to do what we had to do. This I believe was the main reason for not being ablke to complete all the features of the Android Studtn Interface.


	All in all, a good project.
